# Is Pennsylvania Paying the Bills for Other States? The Impact of Certificate-of-Need Laws on Medicaid Expenditure.

### Background:

Certificate-of-need (CON) laws impose bureaucratic costs to healthcare providers in 35 American states. These regulations require healthcare providers planning on opening a new healthcare facility, expanding a current facility, or purchasing medical equipment to first show to a regulatory body that their region needs the service. Pennsylvania (PA) revoked all its CON laws in 1996. 

### Theoretical Prediction:

Our theory models nursing home CON laws as a restriction on the quantity of nursing home services/beds.  As such, the regulation leads to shortages of nursing home beds. When a state like PA revokes the restriction, it is allowed to offer a substitute for neighbor states. Thus, our theory predicts that revoking nursing home CON laws in Pennsylvania will lead citizens of neighbor states to move to PA in order to utilize their nursing home services. Since many of these citizens will need to change residency status, they will also begin receiving Medicaid benefits from PA. Thus, our theory predicts that revoking CON laws in PA will lead to a substantial increase in nursing home Medicaid expenditure, and consequently total Medicaid expenditure. 

### Objective:

This project estimates the impact of revoking CON laws in PA on Medicaid expenditure and its separate components (i.e. Hospital, Nursing Home, Home Health, and Physician/Clinics). We also estimate the impact of revoking CON laws in PA on the amount of nursing homes and nursing home beds in order to test our theory. 

### Methods:

We apply a synthetic control analysis to estimate the impact of revoking CON laws in Pennsylvania in 1996 on Medicaid expenditure and its sperate components, on the quantity of nursing homes, and the quantity nursing home beds.

### Software Utilized:

Stata and ArcGIS.
